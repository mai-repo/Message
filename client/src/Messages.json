Your resilience is truly remarkable, and you have an exceptional talent for holding everyone accountable. A great example of this is in our morning stand-ups, which can often feel sluggish and low-energy. Yet, you consistently bring light and positivity to each meeting, even on days when you're dealing with things outside of work. We’ve all come to rely on that vibrancy you bring, and I hope you find moments to recharge, because you truly deserve rest and care, just as you've always shown for all of us.",

Hopefully, you're taking time for wellness and sticking to your WRAP *eyeball emoji*! The work you've done and attention you've given to this cohort was invaluable. Thank you!!!",
